# Simulated Dataset Visualization

This script generates a simulated dataset and visualizes various aspects of the data. It demonstrates different types of data relationships and distributions using popular Python libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

# Features
1. **Dataset Creation:**
   - Simulates data for each month of the year, including revenue, cost, units sold, and the number of customers.

2. **Visualizations:**
   - **Line Plot:** Displays monthly revenue and cost trends.
   - **Scatter Plot:** Explores the relationship between revenue and units sold.
   - **Bar Plot:** Highlights the number of customers per month.
   - **Heatmap:** Shows correlations between numerical variables.
   - **Box Plot:** Visualizes the distribution of revenue for each month.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

To install these libraries, run:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

# Usage
1. Copy the code into a Python script or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the script. The program will generate and display the following visualizations:
   - Line plot for revenue and cost per month.
   - Scatter plot for revenue vs. units sold.
   - Bar plot for the number of customers per month.
   - Heatmap of correlations between variables.
   - Box plot showing the revenue distribution per month.

# Output
The visualizations will open in separate windows or inline if run in a Jupyter Notebook. Each chart is designed to provide insights into the dataset:
- Line Plot: Understand trends in revenue and cost.
- Scatter Plot: Identify patterns between units sold and revenue.
- Bar Plot: Compare customer counts across months.
- Heatmap: Detect relationships between numerical variables.
- Box Plot: Analyze revenue variability.
