# Guide to Reading the Documentation

## Step 1: Open the `HW1` Folder
- Navigate to the location where you saved the assignment and open the folder named `HW1`.

## Step 2: Locate the Two Files
- Inside the `HW1` folder, you will find two files:
  1. `README.md`: This file contains instructions and a description of the assignment.
  2. `hw1.py`: The Python source code file to run and test the assignment.

## Additional Instructions:
- Read the `README.md` file first to understand the content and requirements of the assignment.
- Use a code editor or IDE to open and edit the `hw1.py` file if needed.
- Ensure Python is installed on your system to run the `hw1.py` file.
